# LexiAssist

![Maven CI](https://github.com/Farshadhvd/LexiAssist/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

LexiAssist is a Java 17 desktop writing assistant built with JavaFX. It provides autocomplete and spelling suggestions while typing, using dictionary-based lookup structures.

## Features

- Load text from a `.txt` file
- Clear editor content
- Autocomplete suggestions while typing
- Spelling suggestions for misspelled words
- Adjacent-swap spelling correction, such as `recieve` → `receive`
- Keyboard-friendly suggestion popup
- Right-side suggestions panel
- Unit-tested dictionary and suggestion logic

## Keyboard Controls

When the suggestion popup is visible:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Arrow Down` | Move to next suggestion |
| `Arrow Up` | Move to previous suggestion |
| `Enter` | Apply selected suggestion |
| `Tab` | Apply selected suggestion |
| `Esc` | Close the suggestion popup |

## Technology Stack

- Java 17
- Maven
- JavaFX
- FXML
- JUnit 5

## How to Run

Make sure Java 17 and Maven are installed.

Check Java:

```bash
java -version
```

Check Maven:

```bash
mvn -version
```

Run the application:

```bash
mvn clean javafx:run
```

## How to Run Tests

```bash
mvn clean test
```

## Example Words to Try

Autocomplete examples:

```text
pro
hel
app
dev
```

Spelling suggestion examples:

```text
helo
wurld
recieve
```

## Design Notes

LexiAssist uses two dictionary lookup structures:

| Component | Data structure | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `HashWordRepository` | `HashSet<String>` | Fast exact-word lookup |
| `PrefixDictionary` | Trie-like prefix tree using `HashMap<Character, PrefixNode>` | Autocomplete lookup |

The exact-word dictionary is useful for checking whether a word exists. The prefix dictionary is useful for finding words that start with the current typed prefix.

The spelling suggestion service generates correction candidates using:

- deletion
- insertion
- substitution
- adjacent character swap

The adjacent-swap operation helps with common typing mistakes such as:

```text
recieve -> receive
```

## Dictionary Data

The bundled `words-small.txt` file is a small sample dictionary used for demonstration and testing. It is not intended to be a complete English dictionary.

A future improvement could allow users to load their own dictionary file.

## Project Note

LexiAssist is an independent portfolio project built to practice Java, JavaFX, data structures, and desktop application design. It was inspired by general text-processing and dictionary concepts from Java learning material, but the implementation, UI, package structure, class design, method names, tests, and project history were created separately.

## Status

Current version:

- Core JavaFX UI is working
- Text loading and clearing are working
- Autocomplete suggestions are working
- Spelling suggestions are working
- Keyboard suggestion popup is working
- Unit tests are included
- GitHub Actions CI is added for automatically building and testing the project
